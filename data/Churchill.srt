1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:08,750
When Napoleon led Boulogne for a year in
his fat bottom boats, and in his grand

2
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:15,020
army He was told by someone there
are bitter weeds in England.

3
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,250
There are certainly, a great many more of
them since the British expeditionary force

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,120
returned.

5
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,140
Sir I have myself full confidence that if
all do their duty, if nothing is neglected

6
00:00:29,564 --> 00:00:34,695
and if the best arrangements are made
and they are being made, we shall prove

7
00:00:34,695 --> 00:00:35,265
ourselves.

8
00:00:35,775 --> 00:00:42,945
once more able to defend our Island home,
ride out the storm of war and to outlive

9
00:00:42,945 --> 00:00:46,775
the menace of tyranny
if necessary for years.

10
00:00:48,605 --> 00:00:50,385
If necessary, alone.

11
00:00:52,155 --> 00:00:54,355
At any rate that is what
we are going to try to do.

12
00:00:55,525 --> 00:00:59,220
That is the resolve of His Majesty's
government, every man of them.

13
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,960
That is the will of
parliament in the nation.

14
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:08,039
The British empire and the french republic
linked together in their cause and in

15
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:13,220
their need will defend to the death
their native soil aiding each other.

16
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,000
Like good comrades to the
utmost of their strength.

17
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:22,180
We shall go on to the end, we shall fight
in the france We shall fight on the seas

18
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:28,445
and oceans, we shall fight with growing
confidence and growing strength in the air

19
00:01:29,895 --> 00:01:33,214
We will defend our Island,
whatever that costs may be.

20
00:01:33,945 --> 00:01:38,195
We shall fight on the beaches, we
shall fight on the landing grounds.

21
00:01:38,884 --> 00:01:44,005
We shall fight in fields and in the
streets, we shall fight in the hills.

22
00:01:44,964 --> 00:01:46,375
We shall never surrender.

23
00:01:46,914 --> 00:01:53,515
And if, which I do not for a moment
believe, this Island or a large part of

24
00:01:53,515 --> 00:02:01,775
it, subjugated and starving, then our
empire beyond the seas armed and guarded

25
00:02:01,835 --> 00:02:08,964
by the British fleet, will carry on the
struggle until in God's good time the new

26
00:02:08,964 --> 00:02:15,175
a world with all its power and might,
steps forth to the rescue and liberation

27
00:02:15,175 --> 00:02:15,805
of the old.
